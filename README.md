# The Pond
The Pond is a game in which the user must use knowledge of Imitation Dynamics and Absorbing Sets to win.

TO PLAY:

The player's goal is to make everyone in their village, situated around a pond, happy. 
One does this by getting all of the villagers to choose of their own volition to become altruists, adding to the community at their own expense.
The math involved in how to do this is explained to the player, but they can also display each villager's payoff's in-game to get some help.
The game ends either when everyone have chosen to be egoists (you must restart the round), or everyone have chosen to be altruists (you've won!).
